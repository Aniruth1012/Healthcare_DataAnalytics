# Healthcare_DataAnalytics
In my healthcare data analytics project, I spearheaded the first phase, focusing on meticulous data preprocessing and prediction tasks. After investing considerable time in sourcing a high-quality dataset devoid of missing values, I employed a combination of data science and machine learning tools for preprocessing. Utilizing feature engineering techniques, I assessed the mutual information scores of variables, adapting the model accordingly to enhance its predictive capabilities. Additionally, I ensured data uniformity by feature scaling both the training and test datasets. Employing a Random Forest classification model on the training set, I achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 90%. To explore further optimizations, I attempted dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Despite the effort, the accuracy remained consistent at 90%. Employing rigorous validation methods, I conducted k-fold cross-validation and presented the results in a comprehensible format, utilizing confusion matrices. With this successful completion of the initial phase, I am passing on the meticulously crafted prediction model to the subsequent phase of the project, where comprehensive data analytics will further refine the insights derived from my work.
